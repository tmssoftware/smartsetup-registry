  description: Spring4D is an open-source code library for Embarcadero Delphi XE and higher. It consists of a number of different modules that contain a base class library (common types, interface based collection types, reflection extensions) and a dependency injection framework.

#  version file: version.txt  # if this line is present, then version.txt must exist, it must have at least one line, 
                             # and the line must be "something: version". like for example "tms.example: 1.0.3". 
                             # The text after ":" will be used as version number to display along the name.

# The settings in this section are only needed if the packages don't follow smartsetup conventions
package options:
  # By default, smartsetup double-checks that the dproj it is going to compile supports the platforms you specified above in the "packages" section.
  # But some packages might have wrong data in the dproj. If you set this to true, smartsetup will ignore whatever the dproj says and only use the info in "packages" 
  ignore dproj platforms: true

  # Use this section only if you are not using the standard smartsetup folders for the packages.
  # Note that if the same folder supports for example Delphi 11 and Delphi 12 (by using Lbsuffix $(auto)), you can 
  # write the same folder for 11 and 12.

  # If the packages in the library use LIBSUFFIX different from the standard (270, 280, etc), you need to specify them here.
  # In most cases, you should just have standard LIBSUFIXes and do nothing here.

paths:
  # the paths below are pattern-matched with the existing library path (case insensitive), and they will be passed to the compiler if they match.
  # Smart setup by default doesn't pass the library path in the user's machine to the compiler, to avoid errors due to broken
  # library paths. Use this only when you need some component like fmxlinux which is not a smart-setup dependency and not something that comes built-in in delphi.
  search paths to preserve:
    - *fmxlinux*

  # this is a temporary fix for https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d/issues/427/wrong-path-in-r-directive-inside-file
  # there is a resource pointing to {$R ..\..\Resources\Spring.Data.ObjectDataSet.dcr} that should point to {$R ..\..\..\Resources\Spring.Data.ObjectDataSet.dcr}
  # and that prevents tmsbuild from compiling.
  # by passing "Resources\something" as library path, the path will resolve to "Resources\something\..\..\Resources\Spring.Data.ObjectDataSet.dcr" which is the correct path.
  # once the issue is fixed this section can be removed.
  build-only library paths:
    - Resources\invalid_folder\
